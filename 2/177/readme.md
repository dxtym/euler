Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral, with diagonals $AC$ and $BD$. At each vertex the diagonal makes an angle with each of the two sides, creating eight corner angles.

For example, at vertex $A$, the two angles are $CAD$, $CAB$.
We call such a quadrilateral for which all eight corner angles have integer values when measured in degrees an "integer angled quadrilateral". An example of an integer angled quadrilateral is a square, where all eight corner angles are $45^\circ$. Another example is given by $DAC = 20^\circ$, $BAC = 60^\circ$, $ABD = 50^\circ$, $CBD = 30^\circ$, $BCA = 40^\circ$, $DCA = 30^\circ$, $CDB = 80^\circ$, $ADB = 50^\circ$.
What is the total number of non-similar integer angled quadrilaterals?
Note: In your calculations you may assume that a calculated angle is integral if it is within a tolerance of $10^{-9}$ of an integer value.
