Consider the natural numbers having at least $5$ prime factors, which don't have to be distinct. Sorting these numbers by size gives a list which starts with:

$32=2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2$
$48=2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3$
$64=2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2$
$72=2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3$
$80=2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5$
$96=2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3$
$\cdots$

So, for example, the fifth number with at least $5$ prime factors is $80$.
