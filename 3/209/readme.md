A $k$-input binary truth table is a map from $k$ input bits (binary digits, $0$ [false] or $1$ [true]) to $1$ output bit. For example, the $2$-input binary truth tables for the logical $\mathbin{\text{AND}}$ and $\mathbin{\text{XOR}}$ functions are:

$x$
$y$
$x \mathbin{\text{AND}} y$
$0$$0$$0$$0$$1$$0$$1$$0$$0$$1$$1$$1$


$x$
$y$
$x\mathbin{\text{XOR}}y$
$0$$0$$0$$0$$1$$1$$1$$0$$1$$1$$1$$0$


How many $6$-input binary truth tables, $\tau$, satisfy the formula
$$\tau(a, b, c, d, e, f) \mathbin{\text{AND}} \tau(b, c, d, e, f, a \mathbin{\text{XOR}} (b \mathbin{\text{AND}} c)) = 0$$
for all $6$-bit inputs $(a, b, c, d, e, f)$?
